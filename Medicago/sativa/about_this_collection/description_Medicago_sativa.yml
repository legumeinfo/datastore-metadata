    accession: RegenSY27x
    name: RegenSY27x
    origin: Samac Lab, USDA
    description: "This plant was selected for high regeneration in tissue culture. It was bred by crossing two plants, first generation selfed (S1) parents from Regen-S (Medicago sativa) and Regen-Y (Medicago falcata) (Bingham, ET. 1991. Registration of alfalfa hybrid Regen-SY germplasm for tissue culture and transformation research. Crop Science 31:1098.) It has purple flowers but clusters more closely with M. falcata than with M. sativa."
