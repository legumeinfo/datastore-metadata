  - 262 Medicago truncatula accessions, plus representatives of various Medicago sister taxa

description: "262 Medicago truncatula accessions were sequenced using Illumina. 55 accessions representing sister taxa and deeply derived lines were also sequenced. Reads were aligned to the M. truncatula v4.0 reference genome, representing the A17 genotype (HM101, Young et al, 2011). Twenty-six M. truncatula accessions (HM001-HM016, HM019-HM021, HM023-HM028, and HM101) were sequenced to 15X average aligned depth. The remaining accessions were sequenced to an average coverage depth of ~6X (Branca et al, 2011; Stanton­Geddes et al, 2013). The 262 Medicago truncatula accessions are the ones used for GWAS studies. The SNP calls for Sister Taxa lines are also available. See Mt5_SNP_calling_pipeline.pdf for more details."
