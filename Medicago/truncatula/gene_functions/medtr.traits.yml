phenotype_synopsis: MtANS (anthocyanidin synthase) gene expression was down-regulated in M. truncatula genotype R108 using an antisense construct.  Anthocyanin levels were strongly reduced in leaf tissues of antisense lines.  The presence of a red anthocyanin-rich circle at the base of the axial side of the leaflet and small red dots on the adaxial side results from anthocyanin deposition.  Six independent transgenic antisense MtANS lines lacked the red circle and spots and another 10 such lines had reduced levels of pigmentation.  There was a strong reduction in the levels of both soluble and insoluble PAs (Oligomeric proanthocyanidins) in seeds, consistent with involvement of ANS in PA biosynthesis.

phenotype_synopsis: Repressing MtbHLH1 (using Chimeric REpressor Silencing Technology) caused an assymetrical pattern of nodule vascular bundle development with variable angles of growth in inoculated roots.  The growth and vigor of aerial parts of the plant was impaired; the nodules were still able to fix atmospheric Nitrogen but the aboveground tissues could not benefit for whatever reason.  Nodules on repressed plants appeared later than in control plants and were smaller in size.

phenotype_synopsis: Expression of MtCBF4 (transcription factor) in M. truncatula was induced by most of the abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, cold, and abscisic acid, suggesting crosstalk between these abiotic stresses.  Upon exposure to a salt medium the primary root growth in the MtCBF4-overexpressing lines was greater than that of the control plants.  MtCAS31 belongs to the CBF regulon and is associated with salt tolerance; under salt treatment, expression of MtCAS31 increased more in d35S:MtCBF4 transgenic plants than in controls.  To summarize, over-expression of MtCBF4 enhanced tolerance to salt stress.

phenotype_synopsis: Mtchit 3-3 expression (class III chitinase gene) is specifically induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in roots of the model legume Medicago truncatula.  Mtchit 3-3 expression was artificially induced with a CaMV 35S promoter in root cells; this stimulated spore germination of Glomus intraradices and Glomus constrictum, and in the case of G. intraradices resulted in a higher probability of root colonization and spore formation.  There was no measurable effect on the abundance of arbuscules within colonized roots.

phenotype_synopsis: Symbiotic infection of roots by rhizobia bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi was inhibited or blocked, i.e. infection threads were not observed despite colonization of root hairs by rhizobia and AM fungal hyphae formed abnormal hyphal swellings with no arbuscles observed.  Nodule organogenesis was initiated but arrested prematurely at the level of primordia as an indirect consequence of the aborted infection.

phenotype_synopsis: A cytochrome P450 gene (CYP716A12) is involved in an early step in saponin biosynthesis and is found in most tissues.  CYP716A12 loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity (lha).  CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid. Transcriptome changes in the lha mutant showed a modulation in the main steps of the triterpenic saponin biosynthetic pathway, which includes squalene cyclization, _-amyrin oxidation, and glycosylation.  Growth of homozygous lha/lha plants was stunted.

phenotype_synopsis: The uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (GT3, UGT73F3) showed specificity for multiple sapogenins and functions in saponin biosynthesis.  Homozygous plants were retarded in growth relative to normal plants, whereas heterozygous plants did not show dwarfism.  Homozygous plants could flower and produce a few pods. The seeds did not show visible morphological changes but took an unusually long time to germinate (at least 3 weeks).  Roots in homozygous lines were very short and less branched compared with the wild type.  Leaf saponin levels did not differ between controls and mutants.  Levels of 5 different saponins were lower in mutant lines (approx. 3-fold) compared with controls, while only one saponin was higher in the mutants.  The large (10-fold) increase of 3-Glc-28-Ara-Rha-Xyl-medicagenic acid in UGT73F3 knockout lines suggests that the UDP-glucose pool is being diverted toward increased formation of non-C-28-glucosylated sapogenins. Levels of the isoflavone formononetin and its conjugates were also increased in UGT73F3 knockouts.

phenotype_synopsis: Rhizobial infection was reduced in quantity and infections were not persistent, i.e. infection threads were arrested after very limited progression within root hair cells.

phenotype_synopsis: MtAOC (allene oxide cyclase) gene expression was partially suppressed in roots following transformation with cDNA in the antisense direction.  These roots exhibited lower jasmonic acid levels and delayed colonization by Glomus intraradices.  The number of arbuscles decreased and their development was delayed, yet their physical structure was unaltered.

phenotype_synopsis: RNA interference (RNAi) was used to repress a M. truncatula CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices.  The normal AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin derivatives) was reduced in repressed plants; mycorradicin derivatives were reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls and the cyclohexenone derivatives were reduced to 30% to 47%.  The RNAi roots turned a yellow-orange color because of C27 apocarotenoid accumulation (the probable substrate of the CCD1 enzyme).  More degenerating arbuscules was observed in RNAi roots.

phenotype_synopsis: Roots growth was not inhibited by exogenous cytokinin application.  Expression of the primary cytokinin response gene, Mt RR4, was not induced by cytokinins.  Plants had an increased number of lateral roots (higher lateral root density) and a strong reduction in numbers of root nodules.  The development of infection threads was inhibited and early nodule primordia development was also impaired.  Expression of early nodulation genes was reduced in plants in which expression of MtCre1 was interfered with by RNAi.

Reduced inhibition of root growth in response to application of exogenous cytokinin benzyl adenine.  Increased primary mycorrhizal infections by Glomus versiforme and Glomus intraradices.  Increased susceptability to damage caused by infection with R. solani necrotrophic fungus and P. medicaginis necrotrophic oomycete as well as larger numbers of P. medicaginis reproductive structures.

phenotype_synopsis: In Medicago truncatula, the Vapyrin (VPY) gene is essential for the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Analyses of mutants shows that the same VPYgene is also required for rhizobial colonization and nodulation.  Plants mutated in this gene have abnormal rhizobial infection threads and fewer nodules, and in the case of interactions with AM fungi, epidermal penetration defects and aborted arbuscule formation.
