description: "Files in this directory include the Trinity-derived transcriptome assemblies of the genotype indicated above. Assembly method: Trinity v 2.0.2, using default settings. Open reading frames (ORFs) using Transdecoder v 2.0.1 (https://transdecoder.github.io/) with parameters, -search_pfam and -m 67. The transcripts were scanned against the UniProt database with parameters (-e-value 1e-5 -num_threads 6 - -outfmt 6). The longest spliced variant was retained from each gene model to develop a set of unique transcripts. The remaining contigs were compared against each other to identify redundant contigs (sequence similarity >= 95%). Only the longest contigs from the latter analysis were used and placed with other unique contigs. The remaining contigs were compared again using the CD-Hit-EST program (Li and Godzik 2006) and the resulting unique sequences were used to create low-redundancy reduced reference transcriptome."
