organism.description: "Pea is an important grain legume, serving multiple roles: as a dry pulse, a green vegetable (with varieties grown for seeds and for pods), as a green manure and cover crop, and as a forage. Pea was domesticated ~10,000 years ago by Neolithic farmers of the Fertile Crescent, along with cereals and other grain legumes (Kreplak et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0480-1)."
