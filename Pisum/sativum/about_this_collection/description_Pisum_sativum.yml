description: "Pea is an important grain legume, serving multiple roles: as a dry pulse, a green vegetable (with 
  varieties grown for seeds and for pods), as a green manure and cover crop, and as a forage. Pea was

  grain legumes (Kreplak et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-019-0480-1)."
