organism.description: "Arachis cardenasii Krapov. & W.C. Greg. is a wild peanut relative native to Bolivia. It has been used by peanut breeders and geneticists in interspecific hybrids with cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea) as a source of pest and disease resistance. A. cardenasii is a diploid  species in the 'A-genome' group of Arachis, similar to A. duranensis, which contributed one of the two subgenomes to tetraploid cultivated peanut."
