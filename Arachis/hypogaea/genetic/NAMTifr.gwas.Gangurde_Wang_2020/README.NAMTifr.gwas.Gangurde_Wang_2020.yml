description: "GWAS dataset from Gangurde, Wang, et al. (2020) NAM Tifrunner mapping population. Nested-association mapping (NAM)-based genetic dissection uncovers candidate genes for seed and pod weights in peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Two nested association mapping (NAM) populations, NAM_Tifrunner and NAM_Florida-07, were used in the publication for dissecting genetic control of 100-pod weight (PW) and 100-seed weight (SW) traits in peanut. This GWAS dataset is from the NAM_Tifrunner mapping population. The study demonstrates the utility of NAM population for genetic dissection of complex traits and performing high-resolution trait mapping in peanut. (Data from Supplementary Table S4: Summary significantly associated SNPs identified for pod weight (PW) and seed weight (SW) in NAM_Tifrunner population with details of annotation of each gene corresponding to the SNPs and their biological role.)"
