description: "A GWAS dataset from Gangurde et al. (2020) NAM Florida-7 mapping population. Nested-association mapping (NAM)-based genetic dissection uncovers candidate genes for seed and pod weights in peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Two nested association mapping (NAM) populations, NAM_Tifrunner and NAM_Florida-07, were used in the study for dissecting genetic control of 100-pod weight (PW) and 100-seed weight (SW) traits in peanut. This GWAS dataset is from the Florida-7 mapping population. The study demonstrates the utility of NAM population for genetic dissection of complex traits and performing high-resolution trait mapping in peanut. (Data from Supplementary Table S5: Summary significantly associated SNPs identified for pod weight (PW) and seed weight (SW)in NAM_Florida‐07 population with details of annotation of each gene corresponding to the SNPs and their biological role.)"
