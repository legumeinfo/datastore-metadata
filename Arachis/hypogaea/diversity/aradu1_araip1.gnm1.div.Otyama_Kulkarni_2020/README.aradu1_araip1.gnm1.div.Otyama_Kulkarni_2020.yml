description: "The USDA peanut germplasm collection currently contains 8,982 accessions. In the 1990s, 812 accessions were selected as a core collection on the basis of phenotype and country of origin. The genotyping data in this collection span the entire available core collection. Each accession was genotyped with the Arachis_Axiom2 SNP array, yielding 14,430 high-quality, informative SNPs across the collection. Additionally, a subset of 253 accessions was replicated, using between two and five seeds per accession, to assess heterogeneity within these accessions. Variants were assigned genomic locations relative to the diploid progenitors of cultivated peanut: A. duranensis and A. ipaensis. Variants for selected additional accessions were added computationally, including A. duranensis and A. ipaensis."
