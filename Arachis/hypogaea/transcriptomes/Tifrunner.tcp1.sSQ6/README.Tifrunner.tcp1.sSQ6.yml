provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://peanutbase.org. There is also a corresponding transcriptome assembly at GenBank.
The PeanutBase repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo, PeanutBase, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo, PeanutBase, and Legume Federation project(s).

description: "Files in this directory included the Trinity genome guided transcriptome assemblies of the genotype mentioned above. Assembly method: Used the genome-guided approach in the assembly pipeline from Trinity v. 2.0.6 r2013-08-14. Normalized reads were mapped to the A. duranensis (A) and A. ipaensis (B) genome separately using GSNAP with the following parameters: '-N 1 -w 10,000 -n 20 -t 6 -nofails'. Once the reads were mapped, the SAM file was run through the genome-guided pipeline.The assembled transcripts were concatenated together into one assembly. Information of whether loci were derived from A. duranensis or A. ipaensis was retained."
