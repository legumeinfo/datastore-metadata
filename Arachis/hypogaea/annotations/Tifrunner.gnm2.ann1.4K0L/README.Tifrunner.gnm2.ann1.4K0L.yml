description: Genome annotation for Arachis hypogaea cultivar Tifrunner, assembly version 2 (Tifrunner.gnm2). Gene models (gene_models_main.gff3) have been projected from Tifrunner.gnm1 into Tifrunner.gnm2 using CrossMap and chain files derived from MUMmer comparisons between the respective assemblies. The CDS, protein, and transcript files are identical to those from Tifrunner.gnm1.ann1.CCJH. Gene model mappings are incomplete: 145 models could not be automatically projected into Tifrunner.gnm2 using CrossMap. See file arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.ann1.4K0L.info_unmapped_models.txt for the listing of unmapped genes.

file_transformation: 
  - 2019-07-26 finished CrossMap projections from gnm1 into gnm2. See file crossmap_arahy_v05.sh for details (S. Cannon)

changes: 
  - 2018-07-26 Initial repository preparation
  - 2020-04-21 Corrected GFF and fasta files to deal with 26 gene models that were duplicated in gnm2.ann1 relative to gnm1.ann1 (24 on 05 and 12 and one on 03 and 13; the latter is not strictly speaking a duplication but a split of the old gene model into two pieces resulting in two smaller models). The previously duplicated models have been renamed on the following chromosomes. The ID modification differs from the original ID string by the last character (changing to Z or 0).
