description: "Postharvest aflatoxin contamination is a challenging issue that affects peanut quality. Aflatoxin is produced by fungi belonging to the Aspergilli group, and is known as an acutely toxic, carcinogenic, and immune-suppressing class of mycotoxins. Evidence for several host genetic factors that may impact aflatoxin contamination has been reported, e.g., genes for lipoxygenase (PnLOX1 and PnLOX2/PnLOX3 that showed either positive or negative regulation with Aspergillus infection), reactive oxygen species, and WRKY (highly associated with or differentially expressed upon infection of maize with Aspergillus flavus); however, their roles remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted an RNA-sequencing experiment to differentiate gene response to the infection by A. flavus between resistant (ICG 1471) and susceptible (Florida-07) cultivated peanut genotypes."
