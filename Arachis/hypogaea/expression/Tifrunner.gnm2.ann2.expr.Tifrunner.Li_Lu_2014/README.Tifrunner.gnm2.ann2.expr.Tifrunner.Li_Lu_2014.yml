provenance: "The files in this directory derive from supplementary data from Li et al., Identification of rapidly induced genes in the response of peanut (Arachis hypogaea) to water deficit and abscisic acid, 2014 June 26;152(2):541-52. The files here are held as part of the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and Legume Federation project(s). If you are conducting research on large-scale data sets for this species, please consider retrieving the data from the primary repositories. If you use the data in the present directory, please 1) please cite the data appropriately - generally referring to the original publications for this data; and if you make use of any significant modifications in the files (noted below under Transformations where applicable), then please also cite the respective database project(s) related to this directory."
