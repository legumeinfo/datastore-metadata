description: "With the aim of understanding the genetic basis and identification of QTLs for drought tolerance, two new RIL mapping populations, ICGS 76 x CSMG 84-1 (RIL-2), and ICGS 44 x ICGS 76 (RIL-3), were used. After screening of 3,215 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on the parental genotypes of these populations, two new genetic maps were developed with 119 (RIL-2) and 82 (RIL-3) SSR loci. Together with these maps and a previous reference map with 191 SSR loci based on TAG 24 x ICGV 86031 (RIL-1; Ravi et al. 2011), a consensus map was constructed with 293 SSR loci distributed over 20 linkage groups, spanning 2,840.8 cM."
