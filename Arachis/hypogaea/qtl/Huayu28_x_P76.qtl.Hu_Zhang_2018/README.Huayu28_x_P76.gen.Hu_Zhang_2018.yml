description: "A mapping population of 146 F2:11 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was produced A1:P2 a cross of the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) maternal inbred line 'Huayu28' and paternal inbred line 'P76'.  The high-resolution genetic linkage map is composed of 2,334 markers (2,266 SNPs and 68 microsatellites) placed upon 20 linkage groups.  The total length of the map is 2,586.37 cM; lengths of linkage groups range from 68.79 to 191.24 cM. This high-density map is the first to be developed in cultivated peanut incorporating de novo polymorphic SNP markers discovered using a SLAF-seq (Specific Length Amplified Fragment Sequencing) methodology.  The authors first developed 433,679 high-quality SLAFs and then discovered that 29,075 of these SNP markers were polymorphic.  There were 7,949 polymorphic markers that followed an aa_x_bb segregation pattern appropriate for linkage analysis, out of which 2,266 SNPs were linked together in the final map. QTLs associated with seed oleic and linoleic acid content were found."
