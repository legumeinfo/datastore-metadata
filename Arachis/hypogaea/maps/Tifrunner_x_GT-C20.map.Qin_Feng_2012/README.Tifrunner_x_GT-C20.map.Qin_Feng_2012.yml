description: "This SSR-based genetic map was constructed using a F5:6 RIL population derived from the cross of Tifrunner with GT-C20.  The map is composed of 26 linkage groups; however, five of these linkage groups included only 2 markers each.  There are 239 total mapped loci (generated using 216 primer pairs) that comprise 238 SSR loci and 1 CAPS marker for ahFAD2A.  The map covers a total distance of 1213.4 cM, exhibits an average distance between markers of 5.7 cM, and displays a range of linkage group lengths from 3.1 to 136.5 cM."
