synopsis: TT_Tifrunner_x_GT-C20_c, a high density genetic SNP map for Arachis hypogaea

scientific_name: Arachis hypogaea

taxid: 3818

scientific_name_abbrev: arahy

genotype:
  - Tifrunner x GT-C20

description: "Whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was used to develop this SNP-based high-density genetic linkage map for Arachis hypogaea. This 'T-population' was a cross of maternal parent Tifrunner and paternal parent GT-C20. The authors also add 15 of the 19 major-QTL linked microsatellite markers from the publication Pandey, Wang et al., (2017). Flanking sequence was used to generate a physical map relative to assembly Tifrunner.gnm1."
