description: "This SSR-based genetic map was constructed using a F5:6 RIL population derived from the cross of SunOleic 97R with NC94022.  The map is composed of 22 linkage groups (five of which had only 2 markers each).  There are 172 mapped loci that comprise 170 SSR loci and 2 CAPS markers for ahFAD2A and adFAD2B.  The map covers a total distance of 920.7 cM, exhibits an average distance between markers of 5.7 cM, and displays a range of linkage group lengths from 11.2 to 127.2 cM. A derived QTL for Tomato spotted wilt virus is reported."
