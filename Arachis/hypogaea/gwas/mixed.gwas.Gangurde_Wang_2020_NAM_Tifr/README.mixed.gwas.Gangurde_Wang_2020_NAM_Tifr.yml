synopsis: GWAS study of pod and seed weight in peanut, conducted on the NAM_Tifrunner nested association mapping population, genotyped using the Axiom_Arachis_58K_SNP array.

description: "GWAS dataset from Gangurde SS, et al., 2020 NAM Tifrunner mapping population. Nested-association mapping (NAM)-based genetic dissection uncovers candidate genes for seed and pod weights in peanut (Arachis hypogaea). Two nested association mapping (NAM) populations, NAM_Tifrunner and NAM_Florida-07, were used in the publication for dissecting genetic control of 100-pod weight (PW) and 100-seed weight (SW) traits in peanut. This gwas dataset is from the NAM_Tifrunner mapping population. The study demonstrates the utility of NAM population for genetic dissection of complex traits and performing high-resolution trait mapping in peanut. (Data from: Supplementary Table 4. Summary of GWAS significant SNPs identifeid for PW and SW in NAM_Tifrunner population)"
