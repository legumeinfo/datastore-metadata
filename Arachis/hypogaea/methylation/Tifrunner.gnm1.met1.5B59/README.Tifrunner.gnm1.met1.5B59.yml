description: "MethylC-seq libraries were constructed as described in the publication. Size selection was performed using magnetic purification beads. The End-It DNA End-Repair Kit (Epicentre) was used to perform end repair on the fragmented DNA. A-tails were added to blunt-end fragments using Klenow 3'-5' exonuclease and dA-Tailing Buffer (New England Biolabs). Methylated NEXTflex DNA adapters (Bio Scientific) were then ligated on using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Bisulfite conversion was done using the MethylCode Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Invitrogen). Between each reaction, magnetic purification beads were used to clean up the DNA. MethylC-seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. See the publication (Supplementary Methods) for additional details."
