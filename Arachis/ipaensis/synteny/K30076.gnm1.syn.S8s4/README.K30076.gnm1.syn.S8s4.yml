description: "Synteny calculations involve identification of orthologous genes by selecting reciprocal top hits between chromosome pairs from an all-against-all blastp search of genes between two species (evalue threshold of 1e-10), followed by DAGchainer to predict chains of syntenic genes in complete genomes. Proportions of synonymous-site changes (Ks) between orthologs are calculated, and synteny blocks are filtered for block-wise median Ks values. Synteny blocks have also been calculated to show these paralogous WGD-derived duplications."
