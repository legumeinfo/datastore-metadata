provenance: "Data in this directory consists of phenotype descriptions and values for South American Germplasm of peanut and wild relatives, collected 1977-1986 by Charles Simpson and other team leaders including Antonio Krapovickas, Walton Gregory, José Valls and Don Banks, and other colleagues. This evaluation work was a collaboration between the International Board for Plant Genetic Resources (now known as Bioversity International) and The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station (now Texas A&M AgriLife Research). Phenotyping was done at Stephenville, TX 76401, between 1982 and 1988. The primary source of the data is the Texas A&M publication: Simpson, C.E., Higgins, D.L., Thomas, G.D., Howard, E.R. Catalog of passport data and minimum descriptors of Arachis hypogaea L. germplasm collected in South America 1977-1986  [1992]. The peanutbase repository can be considered the primary location of the electronic representation of the data."
