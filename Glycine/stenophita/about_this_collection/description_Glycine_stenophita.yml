description: "Glycine stenophita (B.E. Pfeil & Tind.) is a scrambling or climbing perennial that is glabrous or with sparse white hairs covering the stems. Pods are 4 to 6 seeded and seeds are generally barrel shaped with some variation in shape from elliptical to square. G. stenophita is a diploid (2n = 40) member of the B-genome group. It occurs in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
