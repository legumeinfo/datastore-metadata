description: "G. tomentella D3 is a diploid (2n = 40) member of the complex of diploid and tetraploid taxa lumped under the name \"G. tomentella\" but which are reproductively isolated species (e.g., G. tomentella D3 belongs to the D-genome, whereas G. tomentella D1 belongs to the E-genome). It hybridized with G. syndetika (formerly \"G. tomentella D4\") to form the allotetraploid, G. dolichocarpa. G. tomentella D3 is distinguished fromother diploid members of Glycine tomentella species complex by ovated to broadly lanceolate leaves, a seed coat or testa that is dark brown to black (to see the testa the persistent endocarp must be removed) and pods 1.5 to 2 cm long with 2-6 seeds per pod (Hill, 1999). G. tomentella D3 occurs in the Australian territory of Queensland and the Eastern portion of the nearby is land country of Papua New Guinea (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
