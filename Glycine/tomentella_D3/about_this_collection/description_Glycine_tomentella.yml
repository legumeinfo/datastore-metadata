    description: "G. tomentella D3 is a diploid (2n = 40) member of the complex of diploid and tetraploid taxa lumped under the name 'G. tomentella'. G. tomentella D3 is distinguished from other diploid members of Glycine tomentella species complex by ovated to broadly lanceolate leaves, a seed coat or testa that is dark brown to black (to see the testa the persistent endocarp must be removed) and pods 1.5 to 2 cm long with 2 to 6 seeds per pod (Hill, 1999). G. tomentella D3 occurs in the Australian state of Queensland and the eastern portion of Papua New Guinea (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
