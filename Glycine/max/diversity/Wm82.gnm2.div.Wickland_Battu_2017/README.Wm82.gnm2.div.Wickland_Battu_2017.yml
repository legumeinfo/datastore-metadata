synopsis: VCF files containing genotype information for 3 populations of soybean produced by GB-eaSy.  

scientific_name: Glycine max

taxid: 3847

bioproject:

scientific_name_abbrev: Glyma

genotype: Multiple genotypes

description: "Original VCF files received from Dr. Daniel P. Wickland containing genotype information from 3 soybean populations. Population 1 consists of 378 F2 lines resulting from a cross between Prize and an NMU-mutagenized individual of Williams 82. Population 2 consists of 391 F2 individuals from a cross between two breeding lines. Population 3 consists of 81 unrelated accessions that form an association panel (Wickland et al. 2017)."
