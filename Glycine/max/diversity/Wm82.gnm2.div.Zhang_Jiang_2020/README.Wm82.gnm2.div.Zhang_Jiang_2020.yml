  - 1556 cultivated and wild soybean accessions

description: "Genetic variant data derived from whole genome resequencing data of 1,502 diverse accessions from G. max and G. soja. The datasets were generated as part of a project funded by the United Soybean Board, USDA-ARS and Bayer Company. Data sets include a full set of 32 million SNPs, and subsets filtered at minor allele frequencies of 1% and 5%. The pre-released datasets have not been fully peer-reviewed."
