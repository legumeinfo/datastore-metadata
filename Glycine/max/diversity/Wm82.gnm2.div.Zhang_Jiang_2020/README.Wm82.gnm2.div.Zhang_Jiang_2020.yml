description: "Genetic variant data derived from whole genome resequencing data of 1,502 diverse accessions from G. max and G. soja. The datasets were generated as part of a project funded by the United Soybean Board, USDA-ARS and Bayer Company. Data sets include a full set of 32 million SNPs, and subsets filtered at minor allele frequencies of 1% and 5%. The pre-released datasets have not been fully peer-reviewed. Please contact Dr. Yong-Qiang An if you have questions or identify problems (Yong-qiang.an@ars.usda.gov)."
