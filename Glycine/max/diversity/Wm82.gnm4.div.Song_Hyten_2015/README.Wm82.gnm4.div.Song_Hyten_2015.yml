provenance: "The files in this directory originated from NCBI dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).  The NCBI dbSNP repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative; files in this present directory are derived, and may have changes, as noted below. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo, SoyBase, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo, SoyBase, and Legume Federation project(s).
