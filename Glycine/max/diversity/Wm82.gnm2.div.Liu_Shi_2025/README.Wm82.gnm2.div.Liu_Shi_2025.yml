synopsis: Predicted SNP effects relative to genes in Williams 82 gnm2 (Wm82.a2.v1). 

scientific_name: Glycine max

taxid: 3847

scientific_name_abbrev: glyma

genotype:
  - Wm82 and 1,556 soybean whole-genome sequences

description: "SNP functional annotation was performed using Annovar based on the whole-genome sequence assembly Wm82a2v1 and its gene IDs. The input variant file included the following columns: variant chromosome IDs, variant physical positions, reference genome variant allele, alternate variant allele. The annotation file contains the following columns: chromosome, SNP position, reference allele, alternative allele, G. max minor allele, G. soja minor allele, mutation type, gene ID in Wm82a2v1, and the position and function of SNPs in the gene (see HGVS (Human Genome Variant Society) site https://hgvs-nomenclature.org/stable/recommendations/general/
for the nomenclature describing genetic variants)."
