description: "With the release of the third version of the consensus genetic linkage map that added 1141 SNP markers to the map, the objectives of this study were to add 2500 additional SNP markers to the soybean integrated map and select a set of 1536 SNPs to create a universal linkage panel for high-throughput soybean quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping."
