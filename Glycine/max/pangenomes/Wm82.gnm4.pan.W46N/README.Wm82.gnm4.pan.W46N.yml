description: "Studies on structural variation in plants have revealed the inadequacy of a single reference genome for an entire species and suggest that it is necessary to build a species-representative genome, called a pan-genome to better capture the extent of both structural and nucleotide variation. This analysis, termed PanSoy, was constructed using the de novo genome assembly of 204 phylogenetically and geographically representative improved accessions selected from the larger GmHapMap collection. PanSoy uncovers 108 Mb (~11%) of novel nonreference sequences encompassing 3,621 protein-coding genes (including 1,659 novel genes) absent from the soybean Williams 82 reference genome."
