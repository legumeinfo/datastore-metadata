provenance: "The files in this directory derive from supplementary data from Phansak et al. 2016, Multiple-Population selectice genotyping to identify (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) seed protein and oil QTLs. G3 6(6):1635 (2016). The files here are held as part of the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and Legume Federation project(s).
