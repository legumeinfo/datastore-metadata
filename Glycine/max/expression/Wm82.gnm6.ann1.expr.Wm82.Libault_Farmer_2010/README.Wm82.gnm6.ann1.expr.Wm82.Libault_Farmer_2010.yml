provenance: "The files in this directory derive from supplementary data from Libault et al., Complete Transcriptome of the Soybean Root Hair Cell, a Single-Cell Model, and Its Alternation in Response to Bradyrhizobium japonicum Infection. Plant Physiol. The files here are held as part of the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and LegumeFederation projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the SoyBase, LegumeInfo, and Legume Federation project(s).
