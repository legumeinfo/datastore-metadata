commonName: soybean
description: "Soybean (Glycine max), the predominant oil-seed legume worldwide, was likely domesticated in East Asia, ~6000-9000 years ago (Sedivy et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14418). It has many culinary and industrial uses. Some of the culinary uses include: for direct consumption of the green seed (i.e. edamame) and leaves (cooked, much like spinach); for tofu, soymilk, textured vegetable protein, soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and vegetable oil. Industrial uses include: oils, soap, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Soybean is also used as a high-protein forage, and can be prepared for fish- and animal-feed."
