taxid: 3847
genus: Glycine
species: max
abbrev: glyma
commonName: soybean
description: "Soybean (Glycine max) is the predominant oil-seed legume worldwide. Although the center of diversity of the genus is in Australia, the species G. max is Asian, and was likely domesticated in East Asia, ~6000-9000 years ago (Sedivy et al., 2017; https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14418). It has many culinary and industrial uses. Some of the culinary uses include: for direct consumption of the green seed (i.e. edamame) and leaves (cooked, much like spinach); for tofu, soymilk, textured vegetable protein, soy sauce, tempeh, natto, and vegetable oil. Industrial uses include: oils, soap, cosmetics, and biodiesel. Soybean is also used as a high-protein forage, and can be prepared for fish- and animal-feed."

    origin: Southern United States
    description: "Cultivar Lee, which derives from a cross of Chinese lines CNS and S-100, has been widely used as a parent in many breeding projects in the Southern U.S. and in Brazil (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013; http://doi.org/10.1590/S1415-47572013005000041). The variety is notable for resistance to Phytophthora rot, Peanut Mottle Virus, and bacterial pustule (Wysmierski and Vello, 2013)."
