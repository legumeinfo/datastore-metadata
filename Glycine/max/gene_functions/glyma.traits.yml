comments:
  - GmSYP24 was identified as a dehydration-responsive gene with the expressed protein located on the cell membrane.
  - Overexpression of SYP24 in soybean and heteroexpression in Arabidopsis produced insensitivity to osmotic/drought stress and high salinity levels.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans had greater water content and higher activities of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase compared with non-transgenic controls following exposure to abiotic stresses.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans showed altered expression of some aquaporins under osmotic/drought, salt, or ABA treatment.
  - Leaf stomatal density and opening were reduced in SYP24-transgenic Arabidopsis, and ABA-responsive genes were up-regulated.
  - Sensitivity to ABA was decreased during seed germination of both SYP24-transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis.

comments:
  - GmKASI is a fatty acid synthesis enzyme involved in the conversion of sucrose into oil during seed development via elongation of ACP-bound acyl species.
phenotype_synopsis: Soybean seeds from a mutagenized plant exhibited doubled sucrose and halved oil content relative to wild type because of disruption to a Beta-Ketoacyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Synthase ortholog (GmKASI) by chromosomal translocation.

comments:
  - GmPHR1 is expressed throughout nodules and expression increases as nodules develop.
  - Transgenic overexpression increased nodule size and increased the concentration of N and P.
  - PHR1 and GmPHR4 promote each other's expression.
  - When phosphorus is abundant, overexpression of PHR1 represses GmPHT1-4.
  - PHR1 positively regulates GmPAP12 (see Wang, Yang et al., 2020).
phenotype_synopsis: GmPHR1 is a constitutively expressed transcription factor which induces expression of GmPHT1s to promote phosphate uptake. Together, PHRs and PHT1s maintain inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in nodules.

  - NARK is expressed in roots, leaves, and shoots.

comments:
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established through its overexpression in soybean, which increased the number of nodules relative to the wild-type. RNA interference had no effect on nodule number.
  - DRR1 is homologous with other dirigent proteins such as GmDRR2 and GmDRR3.
  - DRR1 promotes the synthesis of (+)-pinoresinol which is needed to increase lignin biosynthesis. Higher levels of lignin content and secondary cell wall deposition function as a physical barrier and inhibit the ability of Phytophthora sojae to infect soybeans.
  - The GmNAC1 transcription factor may bind to the DRR1 promoter to upregulate DRR1 expression and enhance Phytophthora sojae resistance.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR1 was induced in soybean roots by the presence of rhizobia and helped establish a symbiotic relationship that resulted in development of root nodules and nitrogen fixation. Additionally, DRR1 expression increased the resistance of soybean to Phytophthora sojae.

comments:
  - The effect of GmbZIP123 was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana rather than in Glycine max.
  - Overexpression of bZIP123 increased lipid content in seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis.
  - The transcription factor bZIP123 bound to the promoters and upregulated Arabidopis genes for two sucrose transporters (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertases (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6).
  - Cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were consequently boosted in Arabidopsis siliques. The result was greater levels of the sugars glucose, fructose, and sucrose within seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: GmbZIP123 is a transcription factor which promotes expression of sucrose transporter and cell-wall invertase genes. Regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds may be mediated by controlling transport of sugar into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues.

comments:
  - GmGA20ox_a is induced by inoculation with compatible rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum) in soybean root cortical cells during nodule primordia establishment. Mutant rhizobia (nodC-) that lack a chitin synthase gene, and thus cannot produce the Nod factor, don't induce nodulation and concomitant GA20ox_a gene expression.
  - GA20ox_a is expressed at the beginning of nodule development, with levels peaking at 12 hours after inoculation and then decreasing substantially by 48 hours post-inoculation.
  - GA20ox_a gene expression was substantially higher in newly-developing nodules than in other plant structures and is probably nodulation-specific.
phenotype_synopsis: GmGA20ox_a is a gibberellic acid biosynthesis gene that increases levels of gibberellin during early nodulation.

comments:
  - GmGA3ox_1a is induced by inoculation with compatible rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum) in soybean root cortical cells during nodule primordia establishment.
  - GA3ox_1a is expressed at the beginning of nodule development, with levels peaking at 12 hours after inoculation and then decreasing substantially by 48 hours post-inoculation.
  - GA3ox_1a expression is not exclusive to nodule development, appearing in multiple tissues, and likely serves general roles.
  - Nodulation was reduced by RNAi silencing of GA3ox_1a in transgenic soybean hairy roots.
phenotype_synopsis: GmGA3ox_1a is a gibberellic acid biosynthesis gene that increases levels of gibberellin during early nodulation.

comments:
  - Overexpression of STF3 increased nodulation, RNAi knockdown decreased nodulation.
  - STF3 is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor CRY1 and expressed mainly in leaves.
  - The protein product of STF3 migrates from shoots to roots.
  - After migration, it is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CCaMK), which is activated by rhizobial infection.
  - Phosphorylation causes STF3 and FT2a to form a complex.

comments:
  - Expression patterns of NNC1 were studied with GAL4/UAS, GUS, and GFP reporter systems.
  - Its function was confirmed with RNAi knockdown and transgenic overexpression studies.
  - The activity of NNC1 is modulated by miR172c to fine-tune nodulation and symbiosis.
  - miR172c cleaves the protein product of NNC1, allowing ENOD40 to be transcribed.
  - miR172c is, in turn, negatively regulated by NARK (see Searle, Men et. al., 2003).
phenotype_synopsis: NNC1 is a transcription factor that negatively regulates nodule number by repressing GmENOD40.

comments:
  - When phosphate (P) is abuntant, overexpression of PAP12 increases nodule number, nitrogenase and phytase activity, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity.
  - When PAP12 is silenced, nodule number and APase activity are reduced.
  - PAP12 is induced by low-P conditions.
  - PAP12 is induced by transcription factor PHR1 (see Lu, Cheng et. al., 2020).

comments:
  - Transgenic expression of LCLb2 shows that the gene maintains rhythmicity, is expressed most strongly at dawn, and is influenced by light/dark and temperature cycles.
  - The circadian cycle speeds up when the transgenic plant is exposed to higher intensity red or blue light.
  - Knockout of transcription factors LCLa1, LCLa2, LCLb1, and LCLb2 produces short circadian rhythms and delayed flowering time.
  - GmLCL genes share homology with AtCCA1, AtLHY, and VrCCA1L26 genes (see Liu_Zhang_2022.yml)

comments:
  - Comparisons between plants exposed to different day lengths indicated that GmIDD was induced by short days. Overexpression of GmIDD induces early flowering in WT Arabidopsis plants and restores normal flowering time to late-flowering Arabidopsis mutants. Genes acted on by the GmIDD-endcoded transcription factor identified by ChIP-Seq.

  - NNL1 encodes an R protein that interacts with nodulation outer protein P (NopP) of Bradyrhizobium japonicum to prevent symbiosis.
  - Different NNL1 alleles provide immunity to different B. japonicum symbionts.
  - GmSINE1 may be inserted into NNL1, producing an inactive truncated protein. Infection proceeds normally when NNL1 is nonfunctional.
  - NNL1 is induced by innoculation with B. japonicum and expressed in root hairs.

comments:
  - Rj2 interacts with rhizobial NopP to determine compatibility of infecting rhizobia.
  - Different Rj2 alleles provide immunity to different Bradyrhizobium symbionts.
  - When invading NopP is incompatible with host Rj2, Rj2 activates defence gene PR-2 to prevent infection.
  - Regardless of rhizobial compatibility, Rj2 induces ENOD40.
  - Rj2 is expressed in nodules, root hairs, root tips, and shoot meristems.

comments:
  - NF-YC4 positively regulates nodule number and nitrogenase activity.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of ASL6, increasing expression of ASL6 during nodule development.
phenotype_synopsis: NF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates ASL genes to positively regulate nodule number.
