synopsis: "GWAS study of seed weight in soybean, conducted on 309 soybean accessions, genotyped using the SoySNP50K BeadChip."

description: "Genome-wide association study in a population of 309 soybean germplasm accessions using 31,045 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), estimating the prediction accuracy of genomic selection (GS) and marker-assisted selection (MAS) for seed weight (SW). Twenty-two loci of minor effect associated with SW were identified, including hotspots on Gm04 and Gm19. The mixed model containing these loci explained 83.4 % of phenotypic variation."
