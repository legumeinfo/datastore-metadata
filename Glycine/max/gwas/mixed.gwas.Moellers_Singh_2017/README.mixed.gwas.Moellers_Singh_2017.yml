Synopsis:	GWAS study of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in soybean, conducted on 466 accessions, genotyped with the SoySNP50K BeadChip.
PlatformName:	SoySNP50K
PlatformDetails:	Illumina Infinium SoySNP50K BeadChip
Description:	GWAS and GWES studies along with expression studies in soybean were leveraged to dissect the genetics of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), a significant fungal disease causing yield and quality losses. A large association panel of 466 diverse plant introduction accessions were phenotyped in multiple field and controlled environments to: (1) discover sources of resistance, (2) identify SNPs associated with resistance, and (3) determine putative candidate genes to elucidate the mode of resistance.
