  - 282 representative accessions from the University of Minnesota soybean breeding program

synopsis: 282 representative accessions from the University of Minnesota soybean breeding program using a genome-wide panel of 1536 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and evaluated plant responses to SCN HG type 0

genotyping_platform: 1536_USLP1

genotyping_method: Illumina GoldenGate SNP assay with the Universal Soy Linkage Panel 1.0 

description: DNA samples were genotyped using an Illumina GoldenGate SNP assay with the Universal Soy Linkage Panel 1.0 of 1536 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The SNPs with >5% minor allele frequency (MAF) and a missing data rate < 50% were retained, followed by imputation of missing SNP data based on population mean of each marker. Total 1247 SNP markers passed the filters and were used in the subsequent analysis.
