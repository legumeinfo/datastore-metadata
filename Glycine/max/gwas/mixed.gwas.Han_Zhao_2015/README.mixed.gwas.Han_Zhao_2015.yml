scientific_name: Glycine Max

scientific_name_abbrev: glyma

genotype: 
  - 440 diverse soybean landraces and elite cultivars mostly collected in China. 

synopsis: "440 soybean landraces and elite cultivars were screened for resistance to SCN HG Type 0 and HG Type 1.2.3.5.7; GWAS relative to Wm82.gnm2" 

genotyping_platform: Han_Zhao_2015

genotyping_method: Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq)

description: "The Genomic DNA of the 440 accessions were partially sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) approach by Illumina Genome Analyzer II. The 347 million paired-end reads with 45 bp read length were mapped to the reference soybean gen- ome (Wm82.a2.v1) and a mean of 57,418 high quality tags were identified from paired-end reads for each accession. A data set of 36,976 SNPs at Minor Allele Fre- quency (MAF)â‰¥4 % was generated from 57,418 high quality tags. The rate of missing data was controlled at less than 10 % for each accession. The set of SNPs covered 20 chromosomes of soybean. The resulting SNP density of one SNP per 27 Kbp was available in the present study."
