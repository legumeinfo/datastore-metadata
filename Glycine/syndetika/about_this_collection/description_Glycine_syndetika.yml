genus: Glycine
species: syndetika
abbrev: glysy
description: "Glycine syndetika (B.E. Pfeil & Craven) is a twining perennial plant with three leathery, often persistent leaflets. Flowers are somewhat clustered towards to the top of the inflorescences and pods contain 4-9 relatively large square seeds (Pfeil. BE et al., 2006). G. syndetika is diploid (2n = 40) member of the A-genome clade. (This species was formerly part of the Glycine tomentella species complex and was referred to as G. tomentella D4. ) It is has a restricted range in the Eastern Queensland region of Australia (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
