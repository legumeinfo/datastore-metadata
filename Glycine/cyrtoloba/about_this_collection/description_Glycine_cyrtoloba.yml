description: "G. cyrotoloba (Tind) is a perennial plant with twining and stiff stems. G. cyrotoloba pods are curved and somewhat mottled in appearance containing 3-9 seeds that and are dark brown to black in color (Tindale, MD et al., 1984). G. cyrotoloba is a diploid (2n=40) member of the C-genome of Glycine. It is found along the coast of Queensland and Northern New South Wales (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011 ; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
