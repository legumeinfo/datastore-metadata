description: "A complex of diploid and tetraploid taxa are lumped under the name \"G. tomentella\" but are each reproductively isolated species, e.g. G. tomentella D3 belongs to the D-genome, whereas D1 G. tomentella belongs to the E-genome."

    description: "G. D3 tomentella is a diploid (2n = 40) member of the complex of diploid and tetraploid taxa lumped under the name 'G. tomentella'. G. D3 tomentella is distinguished from other diploid members of Glycine tomentella species complex by ovated to broadly lanceolate leaves, a seed coat or testa that is dark brown to black (to see the testa the persistent endocarp must be removed) and pods 1.5 to 2 cm long with 2 to 6 seeds per pod (Hill, 1999). G. D3 tomentella occurs in the Australian state of Queensland and the eastern portion of Papua New Guinea (Ratnaparkhe et al 2011; Gonzalez-Orozco et al., 2012)."
