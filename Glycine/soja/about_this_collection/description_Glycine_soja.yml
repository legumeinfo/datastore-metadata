taxid: 3848
genus: Glycine
species: soja
abbrev: glyso
commonName: wild soybean
description: "Glycine soja is the closest wild relative of soybean, Glycine max. Populations of G. soja exist in the wild in China, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Analysis of genetic differences between the two species suggests that the two separated approximately 200 thousand years ago. The species remain interfertile, and G. soja accessions are used in breeding projects in order to introgress traits such as tolerance to particular diseases or environmental stresses."

    identifier: PI483463
    accession: PI 483463
    name: PI 483463
    origin: Shanxi Province, China
    description: "Glycine soja accession PI 483463 has been identified as being unusually tolerant (Lee et al., 2009; https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esp027). The genome for this accession has been sequenced, partly on the basis of this salt-tolerance trait."

    identifier: W05
    accession: W05
    name: W05
    origin: Henan Province, China
    description: "Glycine soja accession W05 is a salt-tolerant wild soybean whose genome has been sequenced to serve as a reference genome assembly. The W05 accession has been used for genetic studies of several traits, including indeterminacy, seed size, pod number per plant, and seed color (Xie et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09142-9)."
