##### PI483463	
strain.identifier:	PI483463
strain.accession:	PI 483463
strain.name:	
strain.origin:	Shanxi Sheng, China
strain.description:	Glycine soja accession PI 483463 has been identified as being unusually tolerant (Lee et al., 2009; https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esp027). The genome for this accession has been sequenced, partly on the basis of this salt-tolerance trait.
##### W05	
strain.identifier:	W05
strain.accession:	
strain.name:	W05
strain.origin:	Henan Province, China
strain.description:	Glycine soja accession W05 is a salt-tolerant wild soybean whose genome has been sequenced to serve as a reference genome assembly. The W05 accession has been used for genetic studies of several traits, including indeterminacy, seed size, pod number per plant, and seed color (Xie et al., 2019; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09142-9)
