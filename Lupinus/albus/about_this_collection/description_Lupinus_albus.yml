description: "White lupin (Lupinus albus) has been used as a model to study the development of dense root hairs, for phosphorous uptake, in phosphorous-deficient soils. See O'Rourke et al., 2013 (DOI:10.1104/pp.112.209254)."

strains:
  -
    identifier: LAGI01
    accession: LAGI01
    name: LAGI01
    origin: Northern United States
    description: "Lupinus albus strain LAGI01 was used in a study of response to low-phosphorous stress, in O'Rourke et al., 2013 (DOI:10.1104/pp.112.209254). The strain identifier 'LAGI01' is informal, being an abbreviation of 'Lupinus albus Gene Index', and does not uniquely identify a particular accession."
