description: "We generated a high quality assembly of the white lupin (Lupinus albus) genome sequence from the cultivated AMIGA variety. Plant DNA was sequenced using long reads (PacBio), optical maps (BioNano Genomics) and short reads (Illumina). We integrated genetic maps (from Książkiewicz et al., 2017) to further improve the assembly. This website gathers all genomic resources and information related to this project."
