# datastore-metadata
All the LIS Datastore YAML files under one roof.

This repository contains the description_[Genus]_[species].yml and README.[collection].yml files in the LIS Datastore.

All other files are blocked from being added to the repository in .gitignore -- except files that probably shouldn't belong in the Datastore to begin with.

GitHub Actions will now validate your file(s) upon commit and will fail if they don't pass validation.
