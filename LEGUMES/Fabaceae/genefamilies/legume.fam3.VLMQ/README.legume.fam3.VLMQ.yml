taxid: 3803

description: "Files in this directory include the main results for gene families constructed for the legume family.
  Methods are documented at https://github.com/legumeinfo/pandagma. Briefly, the methods are based on gene pairs filtered
  for per-species Ks values. These were clustered using Markov clustering. Sequence match scores of each sequence in
  a family were used to identify outliers, on the basis of score value relative to the median score for the family.
  Remaining sequences were re-clustered, added to the HMM set. Then all sequences were searched against all HMMs, realigned,
  re-screened relative to median match score, and finally used to generate alignments and phylogenetic trees (using FastTree).
  The files labeled with 'base' are the primary gene families, calculated using 18 diverse legume taxa and three outgroup species.
  The base files include, for each family: multifasta protein sets, initial alignments, hidden Markov models, alignments cleaned 
  of indels (non-match state positions), and phylogenetic trees. The base families were calculated using pangene collections 
  for six genera with good representation in terms of species and annotations (Arachis, Cicer, Glycine, Medicago, Phaseolus, Vigna),
  while files labeled with 'sup1' consist of gene family sets for which selected species and annotations were placed into
  the base families by homology. The gene families in the base and sup1 sets correspond by family name; for example,
  Legume.fam3.01000 in the base files is the same family as Legume.fam3.01000 in sup1 (though containing different species sets).
  The A and B sets (baseA, baseB; sup1A, sup1B) designate files (A) and directories/tar-balls (B). Each of the B tar-balls
  can be extracted to produce a directory of approximately 25,000 gene family files of the indicated type (proteomes, HMM models,
  alignments, alignments trimmed of indels, and trees)."
