synopsis: gene families and phylogenetic trees for the legume family

scientific_name: legume

scientific_name_abbrev: legume

taxid: 3803

description: "Files in this directory include the main results for gene families constructed for the legume family. Methods are documented at https://github.com/legumeinfo/pandagma. Briefly, the methods are based on gene pairs filtered for per-species Ks values. These were clustered using Markov clustering. Sequence match scores of each sequence in a family were used to identify outliers, on the basis of score value relative to the median score for the family. Remaining sequences were re-clustered, added to the HMM set. Then all sequences were searched against all HMMs, realigned, re-screened relative to median match score, and finally used to generate alignments and phylogenetic trees (using FastTree)."
