description: "Files in this directory include gene superfamilies based on the legume.fam3 gene families.
  For each of the legume.fam3, a consensus sequence was calculated; then these were used as inputs to
  mmseqs easy-cluster, with min-seq-id=0.40, coverage=0.50, cov-mode 0.
  This produces a file of pairs of legume gene family IDs with homology above the specified cutoffs.
  That file of homology pairs was then clustered using Markov clustering (mcl), with inflation 1.6.
  Given those clusters of legume family IDs, sequences comprising those families were retrieved into 
  14904 superfamily proteome files. Each of those superfamily multifasta files was then aligned and used
  to create a superfamily HMM. Those HMMs were then used as targets for hmmsearch to place proteins 
  from each of 18 selected species (6 non-legume outgroup species and 12 diverse legume species) into the
  best-matching superfamily."
