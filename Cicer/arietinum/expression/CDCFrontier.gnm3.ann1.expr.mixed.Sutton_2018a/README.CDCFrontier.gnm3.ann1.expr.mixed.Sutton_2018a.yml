synopsis: "Study of gene expression in contrasting salt tolerance chickpea genotypes Genesis836 and Rupali, mapped to the CDCFrontier.gnm3.ann1 genome annotation."

description: "Whole transcriptome analysis was performed in leaves of two contrasting chickpea genotypes to investigate the molecular basis for salt tolerance. Salt-sensitive Rupali and salt-tolerant Genesis836 were grown in non-saline (control) or 60 mM NaCl treatment in nutrient solution and leaf tissues were harvested after six days with six biological replicates for transcriptome sequencing. Functional annotation of ‘Genotype’ and ‘interaction’ effect differentially expressed genes identified transcripts with products involved in osmotic adjustment, ion transport, metabolism related to energy generation, stress signalling and regulatory pathways, and photosynthesis."
