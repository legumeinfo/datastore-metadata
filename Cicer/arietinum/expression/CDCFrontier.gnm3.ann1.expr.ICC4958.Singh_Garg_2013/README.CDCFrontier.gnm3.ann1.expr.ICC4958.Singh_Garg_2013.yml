description: "In this study, we aim to present a global view of transcriptome dynamics during flower development in chickpea. We generated around 234 million high-quality reads for eight flower development stages (ranging from 16 to 40 million reads for each stage) and 91 million high-quality reads from three vegetative tissues using Illumina high-throughput sequencing GAII platform. Because of non-availability of reference genome sequence, we mapped the reads to chickpea transcriptome comprised of 34,760 transcripts for estimation of their transcriptional activity in different tissue samples. The transcriptome dynamics was studied by comparison of gene expression during flower development stages with vegetative tissues. Overall design: We collected different tissue samples used in this study and total RNA isolated was subjected to Illumina sequencing. The sequenced data was further filtered using NGS QC Toolkit to obtain high-quality reads. The filtered reads were mapped to 34760 chickpea transcripts and reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) was calculated for each gene in all the sample to measure their gene expression. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq software. The genes preferentially expression during various stages of flower development as compared to vegetative stages and those with speciifc expression were identified."
