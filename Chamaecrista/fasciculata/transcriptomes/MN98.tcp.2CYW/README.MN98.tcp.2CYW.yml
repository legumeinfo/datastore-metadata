provenance: "The files in this directory originated from http://legumeinfo.org. The Legumeinfo repository is considered the primary repository and authoritative. The files here are held as part of the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects, and are made available here for the purpose of reproducibility of analyses at these sites (e.g. gene family alignments and phylogenies, genome browsers, etc.) and for further use by researchers, as that research extends other analyses at the LegumeInfo and SoyBase projects.
