synopsis: "Lablab purpureus accession Highworth, genome assembly 1"

scientific_name: Lablab purpureus

taxid: 35936

scientific_name_abbrev: labpu

genotype:
  - Highworth

description: "The cultivar Highworth was sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technology MinION platform, for 28.4 Gbp and 67x estimated coverage. The reads were initially assembled into 2260 contigs with an N50 of 11.0Mbp and total assembly length of 426.2 Mbp. The assembly was polished for error correction using ~380x of publicly available Illumina short reads previously generated from the same cultivar. Scaffolding was conducted using Hi-C into 11 chromosomes."
