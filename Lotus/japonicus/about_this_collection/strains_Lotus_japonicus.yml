strain.description:	Lotus japonicus ecotype Miyakojima (MG-20) was identified as an early-flowering accession, with traits that distinguish it from other Japanese accessions: low concentrations of anthocyanin in the stem and petals, few trichomes, a more upright habit, broad leaflets and petals, and large black seeds (Pajuelo and Stougaard, 2005, in: A.J. Marquez (ed.), Lotus japonicus Hadbook, pp. 3-24).
