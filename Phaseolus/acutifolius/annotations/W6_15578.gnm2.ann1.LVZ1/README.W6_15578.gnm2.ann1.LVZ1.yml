description: "[Description by Dr. Kirstin Bett] W6 15578 is a wild P. acutifolius accession obtained from the Western Regional Plant Introduction Station of the USDA. Originally collected by O.W. Norvell in Mexico in 1955, it now has the Plant Introduction number PI 638833. It is photoperiod sensitive, has an indeterminate growth habit, small, mottled seeds, and the pods shatter at maturity. It was used as a donor parent in the development of an interspecific hybrid population to improve abiotic stress tolerance in common bean (Souter et al. 2017(1)). W6 15578 was one of the parents, along with PI 430219, of the tepary bean mapping population, BR-06, developed and genotyped at the University of Saskatchewan (Gujaria-Verma et al. 2016(2))."
