description: "[Description by Dr. Phil McClean] The cultivated landrace, Frijol Bayo, was collected in a market in Cordoba, Veracruz, Mexico in 1951 by Howard Scott Gentry. Frijol Bayo is white-seeded, photoperiod insensitive with indeterminate growth habit, and has a hundred seed weight of 12.3 g. It exhibits broad adaptation and is drought (Beebe et al., 2011) and heat (Rodriguez, 2018) tolerant. With respect to biotic stress, it is resistant to common bacterial blight (Rodriguez, 2018), Uromyces appendiculatus, and two leaf hoppers, Empoasca krameri and Phaeoisariopsis griseola (Porch, T., unpublished data).  DNA for the Frijol Bayo genome assembly was isolated from leaves from single seed descent; seeds for Frijol Bayo are available from USDA GRIN (G40001-Seq; PI 692269)."
