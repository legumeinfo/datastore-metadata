strain.identifier:	G19833
strain.accession:	
strain.name:	G19833
strain.origin:	Peru
strain.description:	Andean landrace G19833 was selected for genome sequencing partly due to its resistance to numerous diseases, including bean rust (Uromyces appendiculatus), as well as anthracnose, angular leaf spot, Aschochyta blight, and the bean golden mosaic and bean common mosaic viruses (Hurtado-Gonzales et al., 2017; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdaarsfacpub/1664/). This accession has also been used to generate populations for mapping traits such as phosphorous acquisition and agronomic performance.
