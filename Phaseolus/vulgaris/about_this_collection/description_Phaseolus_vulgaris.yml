taxid: 3885
genus: Phaseolus 
species: vulgaris
abbrev: phavu 
commonName: common bean 
description: "Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was likely domesticated independently both in Central America and in the Andes, from distinct wild gene pools that exist in the two regions. Beans were also carried into North America and were grown by Native Americans there for many centuries. They were carried to Europe by early explorers of the New World, and have undergone about 500 years of additional domestication and selection in Europe. The species has great agricultural variety, and is of critical importance as a high-protein food across the world."

strains:
  - identifier: G19833    
    accession: G19833
    name: G19833
    origin: Peru
    description: "Andean landrace G19833 was selected for genome sequencing partly due to its resistance to numerous diseases, including bean rust (Uromyces appendiculatus), as well as anthracnose, angular leaf spot, Aschochyta blight, and the bean golden mosaic and bean common mosaic viruses (Hurtado-Gonzales et al., 2017; https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdaarsfacpub/1664/). This accession has also been used to generate populations for mapping traits such as phosphorous acquisition and agronomic performance."

    accession: PI 608674
    name: 5-593
    origin: US National Plant Germplasm System
    description: "5-593 has been used by Dr. Mark Bassett at the University of Florida as the recipient parent to introgress many genes for seed coat color and pattern, flower color, and other morphological traits typically to the backcross three generation."
  - identifier: BAT93
    accession: BAT93
    name: BAT 93
    origin: CIAT, Colombia
    description: "Common bean genotype BAT 93, a representative of the Mesoamerican gene pool, was bred for high productivity in tropical conditions at the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), Colombia (Voysest, 1983, 2000). It was selected from a double cross population developed between landraces. BAT 93 was selected for mutagenesis (Table 1) because it is one of the parents of the core common bean mapping population (Freyre et al., 1998), it has been used in the generation of a large BAC library (Kami et al., 2006), and it is amenable for production in temperate and tropical environments and under growth chamber, greenhouse, or field conditions (Blair et al., 2005). BAT 93 also possesses several desirable characteristics (Table 1), including disease resistance (Sanchez-Valdez et al., 2004). Seed of BAT 93 were carefully generated for the experiment from single plant selections and confirmed for homogeneity using simple sequence repeat marker analysis at CIAT."
