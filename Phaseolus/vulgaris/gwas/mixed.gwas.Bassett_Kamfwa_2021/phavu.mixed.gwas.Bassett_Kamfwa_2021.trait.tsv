Seed beany flavor	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The flavor of Beany intensity was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (low to high). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed bitter flavor	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The flavor of Bitter intensity was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (low to high). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed earthy flavor	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The flavor of Earthy intensity was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (low to high). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed starchy flavor	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The flavor of Starchy intensity was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (low to high). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed total flavor	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The flavor of Total flavor intensity was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (low to high). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Cotyledon texture	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The Cotyledon texture was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (mushy to very gritty/firm). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed coat perception	Cooked seeds were evaluated by a trained sensory panel of four using the quantitative descriptive analysis approach. The texture of Seed-coat perception was evaluated using a 5-point attribute intensity scale (imperceptible to tough and lingering). To prepare samples, seeds soaked for 12-hours were loaded into large tea bags. The beans were then boiled in distilled water for a cooking time determined for that genotype by the Mattson cooker method.
Seed weight	Raw seed weight was recorded as grams per 100 seeds.
Seed cooking time	Cooking time was measured in minutes using automated Mattson cookers. Samples of 30 seeds, following equilibration to 10-14% moisture in a 4 ℃ humidity chamber, were soaked for 12 hours in distilled water. The soaked seeds were loaded into the Mattson cookers which were then placed into boiling distilled water. The device includes twenty-five 2-mm diameter pins at the tips of 65-gram steel rods that pierce the beans as they cook and soften. Software records the cooking-time associated with each pin as it drops, with the 80% cooking time regarded as the period required to fully cook each sample.
Seed water absorption	Samples of 30 seeds, following equilibration to 10-14% moisture in a 4 ℃ humidity chamber, were soaked for 12 hours in distilled water. The seeds were weighed before cooking and the Soak water uptake was calculated and expressed as a percentage.
Cooked seed water absorption	Samples of 30 seeds, following equilibration to 10-14% moisture in a 4 ℃ humidity chamber, were soaked for 12 hours in distilled water. The soaked seeds were then boiled in distilled water, weighed after cooking, and the Total water uptake was calculated and expressed as a percentage.
