description: "The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic control of days to flowering using a whole genome association approach on a panel of 192 highly homozygous common bean genotypes purposely developed from landraces using single-seed descent. The phenotypic characterization was carried out at two experimental sites throughout two growing seasons, using a randomized partially replicated experimental design. The same plant material was genotyped using double digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, producing, after a strict quality control, a dataset of about 50k SNPs after filtering against: loci with >10% missing values; individuals with >10% missing loci; markers with MAF<5%; and heterozygosity>=2%. The GWAS revealed significant and meaningful associations between days to flowering and several SNP markers; seven genes are proposed as the best candidates to explain the detected associations."
