description: "GWAS study of pod dehiscence in Phaseolus vulgaris dry beans, using the Andean and Mesoamerican Diversity Panels. Association mapping was carried out with generalized linear models and results were visualized with the QQMAN package in R.  Regions of significance were delimited as the areas between the first and last significant SNPs on a chromosome.  A Bonferroni-corrected alpha of 0.05 was used to determine the significance of SNPs after they met the threshold established as a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.1."
