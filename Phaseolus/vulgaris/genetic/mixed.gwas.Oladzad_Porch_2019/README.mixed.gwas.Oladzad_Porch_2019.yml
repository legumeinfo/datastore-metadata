  - "Bean Abiotic Stress Evaluation (BASE) panels for genetic discovery in Phaseolus vulgaris, that included variation in high temperature and drought stress responses, were assembled using genotypes relevant to agriculture in Central America and Africa. BASE panels included the BASE_120 [genotypes from 93 Middle American (MA), 22 Andean, 4 Tepary bean pools], BASE_Meso [119 genotypes mostly from Race Mesoamerica], and BASE_Andean [124 Andean genotypes]."

description: The genetic improvement of economically important production traits of dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), for geographic regions where production is threatened by drought and high temperature stress, is challenging because of the complex genetic nature of these traits. Large scale SNP data sets for the two major gene pools of bean, Andean and Middle American, were developed by mapping multiple pools of genotype-by-sequencing reads and identifying over 200k SNPs for each gene pool against the most recent assembly of the P. vulgaris genome sequence. Moderately sized Bean Abiotic Stress Evaluation (BASE) panels, consisting of genotypes appropriate for production in Central America and Africa, were assembled. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the BASE populations represented broad genetic diversity for the appropriate races within the two gene pools. Joint mixed linear model genome-wide association studies with data from multiple locations discovered genetic factors associated with four production traits in both heat and drought stress environments using the BASE panels. Pleiotropic genetic factors were discovered using a multi-trait mixed model analysis. SNPs within or near candidate genes associated with hormone signaling, epigenetic regulation, and ROS detoxification under stress conditions were identified and can be used as genetic markers in dry bean breeding programs.
