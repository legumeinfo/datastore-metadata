description: "In this study, gene-based markers were used for mapping in a recombinant inbred (RI) population of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Gene-based markers were developed that corresponded to genes controlling mutant phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana, genes undergoing selection during domestication in maize, and genes that function in a biochemical pathway in A. thaliana. The resulting LOD 2.0 map is 1,545 cM in length and consists of 275 gene-based and previously mapped core markers."
