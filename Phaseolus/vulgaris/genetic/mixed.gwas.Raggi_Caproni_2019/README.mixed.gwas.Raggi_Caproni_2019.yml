synopsis: "GWAS study of control of flowering time in common bean, using a panel of 192 lines."

scientific_name: Phaseolus vulgaris

taxid: 3885

scientific_name_abbrev: phavu

genotype: 
  - Panel of 192 highly homozygous common bean genotypes purposely developed from landraces using single-seed descent, for the purpose of assessing genetic control of days to flowering

description: "The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic control of days to flowering using a whole genome association approach on a panel of 192 highly homozygous common bean genotypes purposely developed from landraces using Single Seed Descent. The phenotypic characterization was carried out at two experimental sites throughout two growing seasons, using a randomized partially replicated experimental design. The same plant material was genotyped using double digest Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing producing, after a strict quality control, a dataset of about 50 k Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The Genome-Wide Association Study revealed significant and meaningful associations between days to flowering and several SNP markers; seven genes are proposed as the best candidates to explain the detected associations."
