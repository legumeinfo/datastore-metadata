description: "This common bean consensus map was created using the DB (DOR364_x_BAT477, Mesoamerican intra-gene pool cross), DG (DOR364_x_G19833, inter-gene pool cross), and BJ (BAT93_x_JALOEEP558, inter-gene pool cross) mapping populations.  The consensus map contains a total of 1010 markers; these include 446 SNP, 392 SSR, 99 RAPD, 45 RFLP, 22 AFLP, 5 STS, and one phenotypic marker.  The total size of the map is 2041 cM, there are 11 linkage groups, and the average size of a linkage group is 185 cM (range is between 131 cM for Pv10 to 276 cM for Pv02).  There is an average of 91 markers per linkage group (range is between 151 on Pv02 to 67 on Pv09), 83% of which markers appear as single copies, and the average inter-marker distance is 2 cM.  The numbers of anchor markers shared between the component populations are 98, 87, 14, and 4 markers for the DG-DB, DG-BJ, DB-BJ, and DG-BJ-DB population sets, respectively."
