description: "The objective of this research was to determine the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling phenological traits (days to flowering, days to end of flowering, days to harvest as green pod, and days to maturity), seed size traits (seed length, seed height, seed width, and seed weight), and seed quality traits (water absorption, and coat proportion), in common bean. A population of 104 F7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter-gene pool cross between Xana, and Cornell 49242, was used to develop a genetic linkage map. The QTL analyses were carried out over three environments using the mean environment data with composite interval mapping. Thirty-one QTLs for ten traits were found to be significant in at least one environment and in the mean environment data, the number of significant QTLs identified per trait ranged from two to five. Twenty-seven of these QTLs mapped forming clusters in eight different chromosomal regions."
