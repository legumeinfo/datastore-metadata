synopsis: "Three RIL populations, from DOR364xG19833, BAT93xJALOEEP558, and G2333xG19839, were used to find QTLs for seed tannin concentration."

scientific_name: Phaseolus vulgaris

taxid: 3885

genotype:
  - DOR364 x G19833 (87 F9:11 RILs)
  - BAT93 x JALOEEP558 (72 F8:11 RILs)
  - G2333 x G19839 (84 F5:8 RILs)

description: "The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed tannin concentration in common bean and Mendelian genes for seed coat color and pattern. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines, derived from crosses between the Andean and Mesoamerican genepools, were used for QTL identification and for mapping STS markers associated with seed color loci. Data were drawn from Figure 2 in the publication."
