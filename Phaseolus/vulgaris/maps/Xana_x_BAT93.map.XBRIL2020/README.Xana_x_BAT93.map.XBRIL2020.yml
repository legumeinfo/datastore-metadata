synopsis: "Genetic map from a RIL population from Xana x BAT93."

scientific_name: Phaseolus vulgaris

taxid: 3885

scientific_name_abbrev: phavu

genotype: 
  - Xana x BAT93

description: "The Xana x BAT93 (XB) population was genotyped using genotyping by sequencing (GBS), and the corresponding genetic linkage map consists of 497 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a total length of 1547 cM. NOTE: Pv07 is truncated and Pv10 is not given due to segregation distortion associated with the BAT93 alleles."
