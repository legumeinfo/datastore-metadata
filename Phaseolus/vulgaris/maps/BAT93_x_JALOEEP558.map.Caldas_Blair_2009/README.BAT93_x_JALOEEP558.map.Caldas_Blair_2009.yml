description: "The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed tannin concentration in common bean and Mendelian genes for seed coat color and pattern. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines, derived from crosses between the Andean and Mesoamerican genepools were used for QTL identification and for mapping STS markers associated with seed color loci. This map was created from the BAT93 x JALOEEP558 set."
