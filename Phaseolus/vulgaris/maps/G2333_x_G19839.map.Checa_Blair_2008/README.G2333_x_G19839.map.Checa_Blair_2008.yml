description: "This G2333 x G19839 genetic map contains all 11 common bean linkage groups. It has a total length of 1175 cM and the publication Figure 2 displays 149 mapped total markers (four of these markers generated two loci each). The map contains 79 microsatellite, 57 RAPD, 8 SCAR, and 3 STS markers; there is also a marker for the seed protein phaseolin (Phs) and a morphological marker for flower color (V). This map could be aligned with the common bean integrated map of Freyre, Skroch et al. (1998) based on positions of shared SSR markers (see also Blair, Pedraza et al., 2003). The reported QTL-related marker positions and lengths of individual linkage groups were taken from Figure 2 in the publication."
