description: "A 75-member F8 mapping population derived from the cross of BAT93 with JALO EEP558 was used to produce a core linkage map for common bean.  The total length of the map is 1226 cM and it is composed of 11 linkage groups.  The total of 563 mapped marker loci includes 120 RFLPs, 430 RAPDs, and additional isozyme and phenotypic markers."
