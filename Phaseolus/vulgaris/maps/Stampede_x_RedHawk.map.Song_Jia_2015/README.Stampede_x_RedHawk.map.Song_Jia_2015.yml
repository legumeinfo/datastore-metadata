  - Stampede x RedHawk

description: "Analysis of 267 F2 plants from a cross of varieties Stampede × Red Hawk with the BARCBean6K_1 and BARCBean6K_2 BeadChips resulted in linkage maps with a total of 7040 markers including 7015 SNPs. With the linkage map, a total of 432.3 Mb of sequence from 2766 scaffolds was anchored to create the Phaseolus vulgaris v1.0 assembly, which accounted for approximately 89% of the 487 Mb of available sequence scaffolds of the Phaseolus vulgaris v0.9 assembly."
