synopsis: "A map of 175 AFLP, 27 microsatellite, 30 SCAR, 33 ISSR, and 12 RAPD markers, as well as 13 loci coding for seed proteins, and four traditional genes (Fin/fin for growth habit, Asp/asp for seed coat shininess, P/p for seed color, and I/i for resistance to bean common mosaic virus)."

description: "This genetic linkage map includes 175 AFLP, 27 microsatellite, 30 SCAR, 33 ISSR, and 12 RAPD markers.  The map also contains 13 loci coding for seed proteins, and four traditional genes (Fin/fin for growth habit, Asp/asp for seed coat shininess, P/p for seed color, and I/i for resistance to bean common mosaic virus).  Therefore the map comprises a total of 294 markers, its total length is 1042 cM, and the average marker distance is 3.53 cM.  The map consists of 14 linkage groups that were correlated with the 11 linkage groups of the integrated linkage map of Freyre, Skroch et al. (1998) by using anchor markers included in previously published bean maps.  The linkage groups B02, B03, and B04 of the Freyre, Skroch et al. (1998) consensus map each correspond to a pair of linkage groups in the Perez-Vega, Paneda et al. (2010) map."
