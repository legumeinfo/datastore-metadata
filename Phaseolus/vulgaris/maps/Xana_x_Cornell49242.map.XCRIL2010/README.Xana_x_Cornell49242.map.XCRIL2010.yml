description: "A population of 104 F7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter-gene pool cross between Xana and Cornell 49242 was used to develop a genetic linkage map including 175 AFLPs, 27 microsatellites, 30 SCARs, 33 ISSRs, 12 RAPDs, 13 loci codifying for seed proteins, and the four genes Fin,fin (growth habit); Asp,asp (seed coat shininess); P,p (seed color); and I,i (resistance to bean common mosaic virus). The map has a total length of 1,042 cM distributed across 11 linkage groups aligned to those of the core linkage map of bean using common molecular markers as anchor points."
