description: "[description from Dr. Phil McClean] Accession 5-593 was developed by Dr. Mark Bassett at the University of Florida. 5-593 traces back to B-351, a black-seeded variety developed by Dr. Jim Beaver, University of Puerto Rico from the cross of the Middle American varieties Bonita (white-seeded) and Jamapa (black-seeded). Dr. Bassett irradiated B-351, selected a line with determinate growth habit, back-crossed the selected line to B-351, and selected the plant with best determinate growth habit in the F2 and F3 generations. The best segregant in the F3 generation was designated 5-593. 5-593 was initially obtained from the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS; aka GRIN) as PI 608674. Dr. Bassett used 5-593 as the recipient parent to introgress many genes for seed coat color and pattern, flower color, and other morphological traits typically to the backcross three generation. These introgression lines are also available from the USDA NPGS."
