description: "Genome assembly for Phaseolus vulgaris accession Labor Ovalle. Labor Ovalle is a race Guatemala common bean variety released by the Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology (ICTA). Labor Ovalle was a landrace native to the highlands that was improved by selection efforts of the ICTA breeding program led by Dr. Fernando Aldana. Labor Ovalle is a round-seeded Bolonilio market class bean. The project was a joint effort of North Dakota State University and Hudson/Alpha Institute for Biotechnology. Funding for the project was provided by the United States Agency for International Development through the Feed the Future Legume Innovation Laboratory."
