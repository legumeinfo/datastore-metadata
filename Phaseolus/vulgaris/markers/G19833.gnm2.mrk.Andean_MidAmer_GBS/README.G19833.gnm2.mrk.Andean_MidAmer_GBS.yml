  - G19833

genotyping_platform: Andean_MidAmer_GBS

description: "SNP markers were identified using GBS of the Bean Abiotic Stress Evaluation (BASE) panels for Phaseolus vulgaris, relative to the G19833.gnm2 assembly. The BASE panels included the BASE_120 [genotypes from 93 Middle American (MA), 22 Andean, 4 Tepary bean pools], BASE_Meso [119 genotypes mostly from Race Mesoamerica], and BASE_Andean [124 Andean genotypes]. Haplotypes from the Andean and Middle American gene pools originate from https://gsajournals.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supplemental_Material_for_Oladzad_et_al_2019/7965305. The combined marker file is derived from the two haplotype files."
