synopsis: "Three cDNA libraries generated by the Bean EST project were analyzed for the presence of SSRs. A total of 219 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found to carry 240 SSRs (named EST-SSR), whereas 714 genomic sequences contained 471 SSRs (named genomic-SSR)."

description: "3 cDNA libraries generated by the Bean EST project (http://lgm.esalq.usp.br/BEST/), comprising a unigene collection of 3126 sequences and a genomic microsatellite-enriched library, were analyzed for the presence of SSRs. A total of 219 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found to carry 240 SSRs (named EST-SSR), whereas 714 genomic sequences contained 471 SSRs (named genomic-SSR). A subset of 80 SSRs, 40 EST-SSRs, and 40 genomic-SSRs were evaluated for molecular polymorphism in 23 genotypes of cultivated beans from the Mesoamerican and Andean genetic pools, including Brazilian cultivars and 2 related species. Of the common bean genotypes, 31 EST-SSR loci were polymorphic, yielding 2–12 alleles as compared with 26 polymorphic genomic-SSRs, accounting for 2–7 alleles. Cluster analysis from data using both genic and genomic-SSR revealed a clear separation between Andean and Mesoamerican beans. The usefulness of these loci for distinguishing bean genotypes and genetic mapping is discussed."
