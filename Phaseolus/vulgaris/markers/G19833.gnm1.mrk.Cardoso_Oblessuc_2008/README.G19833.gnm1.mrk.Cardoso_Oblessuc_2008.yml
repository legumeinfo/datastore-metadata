description: "The objective of this work was to develop new microsatellite markers in common bean. Ninety-nine new microsatelitte loci were developed from a microsatellite-enriched library for (CT)8  and (GT)8  motifs, from CAL-143 line. The majority of microsatellite sequences (51%) was related to cellular metabolism. The remaining sequences were associated to transcription functions. Only 17.2% of the sequences presented some level of similarity with other plant species genes."
