description: "Here we report the first successful assignment of 15 SSR markers to the Phaseolus vulgaris molecular linkage map. A total of 37 SSR primer pairs were developed and tested for amplification and product-length polymorphism with BAT93 and Jalo EEP558, the parental lines of an F7 recombinant inbred (RI) population previously used for the construction of a common bean molecular linkage map. Sixteen of the SSRs polymorphic to the parental lines were analyzed for segregation and 15 of them were assigned to seven different linkage groups, indicating a widespread distribution throughout the bean genome. Map positions for genes coding for DNAJ-like protein, pathogenesis-related protein 3, plastid-located glutamine synthetase, endochitinase, sn-glycerol-3 phosphate acyltransferase, NADP-dependent malic enzyme, and protein kinase were determined for the first time. Addition of three SSR loci to linkage group B4 brought two separated smaller linkage groups together to form a larger linkage group. Analysis of allele segregation in the F7 RI population revealed that all 16 SSRs segregated in the expected 1:1 ratio. These SSR markers were stable and easy to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). They should be useful markers for genetic mapping, genotype identification, and marker-assisted selection of common beans."
