synopsis: "A set of 52,201 SNPs reported by Escobar, Oladzad et al. (2022) based on genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) of a multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) dry bean population of 1,050 F5:7 RILs. Reads were mapped and sorted against the G19833.gnm2 reference assembly for common bean."

description: "A multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population, comprising 1,050 F5:7 recombinant inbred lines, was developed to facilitate mapping of loci and breeding efforts related to dry bean resistance against white mold (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum). Genomic libraries, developed using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), were sequenced for each genotype. Reads were mapped and sorted against the G19833.gnm2 reference genome for common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris v2.1) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool and SAMtools. Unified Genotyper was used to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The final HapMap possessed a total of 52,201 SNPs after filtering sequence data for a minimum read depth of two, discarding markers with 25% missing data, eliminating genotypes with more than 90% missing genetic information, and keeping SNPs with a minor allele frequency  > 0.01."
