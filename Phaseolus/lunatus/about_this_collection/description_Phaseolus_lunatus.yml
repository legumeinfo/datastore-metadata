description: "The lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), initially from South and Central America, is an herbaceous plant that is a part of the legume family (Fabaceae). It is commonly known as the lima bean, butter bean, sieva bean, double bean or Madagascar bean, is a legume grown for its edible seeds or beans. The two gene pools, meso and south American, of cultivated lima beans is believed to point to independent domestication events. The Mesoamerican lima bean is distributed in neotropical lowlands while the other is found in the western Andes."

strains:
  - identifier: G27455   
    accession: G27455
    name: G27455
    origin: Colombia
    description: "G27455 was selected from MI population, which is the most widespread among domesticated gene pools. Domesticated accessions have low heterozygosity, which reduces the complexity of genome assembly. G27455 is cultivated in the north of Colombia, where temperatures are very high all year, suggesting it may be a good source of candidate genes for resistance to heat and drought stress."

  - identifier: B2C
    accession: PI 549515
    name: B2C
    origin: Delaware, USA
    description: "A germplasm release designated B2C (PI 549515), made jointly by USDA-ARS and the Delaware Agricultural Experiment Station in 1976, had resistance to downy mildew races A, B, C, and D. B2C arose from crosses of PI 195342, ‘Bridgeton’ and US 1068, a sibling of ‘Bridgeton’ (Thomas and Fisher, 1980)."

  - identifier: UC92
    accession: "UC 92"
    name: "UC 92"
    origin: California, USA
    description: "UC 92 is a large lima bean with bush growth habit, medium days to maturity, resistance to root-knot nematode, and poor tolerance to Lygus."
  - identifier: UC_Haskell
    accession: UC Haskell
    name: UC Haskell
    origin: "CIAT, Columbia"
    description: "UC Haskell is a F10 progeny from 2000 UCD greenhouse cross #53 of the variety UC Cariblanco N with introduction “P&T 4255” from the international P.Lunatus germplasm blank at CIAT, Columbia. The UC Davis Grain Legume program is the owner and Steve Temple is the breeder. UC Haskell has a spreading, indeterminate vine growth habit, dark green foliage without pigmentation, white flowers, a concentrated “crown” set plus significant podset on the lateral branches, which are prostrate and twining. The plant toot system is extensive and highly-branched and pulls moisture down to several feet in most soil profiles. The name UC Haskell is in honor of a respected baby lima industry colleague killed in a 2008 auto accident.)"
