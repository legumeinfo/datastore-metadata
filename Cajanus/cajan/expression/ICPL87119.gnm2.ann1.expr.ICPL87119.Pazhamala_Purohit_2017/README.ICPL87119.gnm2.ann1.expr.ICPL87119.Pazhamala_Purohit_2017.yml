description: "A gene expression atlas of Cajanus cajan has been developed in this study using 30 samples from Asha genotype (ICPL 87119), representing different developmental stages from germination to senescence. This dataset at LIS uses reads mapped to the ICPL87119 pigeonpea reference genome ICPL87119.gnm1.ann1."
