  - CB27 × IT82E-18/Big Buff

description: "Three cowpea RIL populations which segregate for Fot race 4 resistance were used for QTL mapping studies. The CB27 (resistant) × IT82E-18/Big Buff (susceptible) population consisted of 162 RILs and was advanced to the F8 generation by single seed descent. IT82E-18 is an advanced breeding line developed at IITA which was released as cultivar Big Buff in Australia (Imrie 1995). IT82E-18 is highly susceptible to Fot race 4. A/a=CB27 genotype; B/b=IT82E-18 genotype; U=uncalled; X=heterozygous."
