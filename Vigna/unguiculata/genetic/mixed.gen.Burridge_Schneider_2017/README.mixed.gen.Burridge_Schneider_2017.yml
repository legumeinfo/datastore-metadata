description: "This study implemented manual phenotyping (shovelomics) and automated image phenotyping (DIRT) on a 189-entry diversity panel of cowpea to reveal biologically important variation and genome regions affecting root architecture phenes. A diversity panel of 189 entries including traditional cultivars (landraces) and elite breeding lines representing worldwide cowpea genetic diversity was assembled and seed-multiplied by University of California—Riverside (UCR)."
