  - IT84S-2246-4 x TVu-14676

genotyping_method: "The IT84S-2246 x TVu-14676 population was genotyped at the F8 generation using biallelic SNP markers using the 1536 Illumina Golden Gate Assay."

description: "In this study, we identified three QTLs: Hbs-1, Hbs-2, and Hbs-3, associated with heat-induced browning of seed coats using the cowpea RIL populations IT93K-503-1 x CB46 and IT84S-2246 x TVu14676. SNP markers were identified which co-segregated with the heat-induced browning of seed coats phenotype in the Hbs-1 and Hbs-3 loci, and could be used for indirect selection in breeding a higher quality cowpea grain. Additionally, ethylene forming enzymes were identified as a cowpea candidate gene for the Hbs-1 locus and an ACC synthase 1 gene was identified as a cowpea candidate gene for the Hbs-3 locus."
