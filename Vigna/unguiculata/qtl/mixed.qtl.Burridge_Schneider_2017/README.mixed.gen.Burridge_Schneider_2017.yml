  - 189-entry diversity panel

description: "This study implemented manual phenotyping (shovelomics) and automated image phenotyping (DIRT) on a 189-entry diversity panel of cowpea to reveal biologically important variation and genome regions affecting root architecture phenes. A diversity panel of 189 entries including traditional cultivars (landraces) and elite breeding lines representing worldwide cowpea genetic diversity was assembled and seed-multiplied by University of California—Riverside (UCR)."

genotyping_platform: Cowpea1MSelectedSNPs

genotyping_method: "Six bi-parental RIL populations were genotyped with an Illumina GoldenGate assay for 1,536 EST-derived SNP markers. The map resolution was improved by genotyping seven additional RIL populations."
