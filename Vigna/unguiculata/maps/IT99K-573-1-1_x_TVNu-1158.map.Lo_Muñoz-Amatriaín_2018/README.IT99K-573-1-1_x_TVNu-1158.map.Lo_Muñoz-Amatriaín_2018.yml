description: "Cowpea domestication-related traits (DRTs) were studied with a biparental mapping population of F8 RILs derived from a cross between IT99K-573-1-1 and TVNu-1158, cultivated and wild cowpea accessions, respectively. IT99K-573-1-1 is an early-maturing, white-seeded, high-yielding and Striga-resistant variety that was released in Nigeria under the name SAMPEA 14. TVNu-1158 is small seeded and has a perennial growth habit. "
