description: "A MAGIC (Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross) population for cowpea from eight founder parents which are genetically diverse and carry many abiotic and biotic stress resistance, seed quality and agronomic traits relevant to cowpea improvement in the USA and sub-Saharan Africa. The eight parents were inter-crossed using structured matings to ensure the population would have balanced representation from each parent, followed by single-seed descent, resulting in 305 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) each carrying a mosaic of genome blocks contributed from all founders. These lines were on average 99.74% homozygous while also diverse in agronomic traits across environments."
