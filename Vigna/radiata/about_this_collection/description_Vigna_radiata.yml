description: "Mungbean (Vigna radiata), also known as moong bean, green gram, is a fast-growing warm-season legume and has a diploid chromosome number of 2n=22. Mungbean is mainly cultivated today in China, India and Southeast Asia but can be found in dry regions within Southern Europe and United States. Mungbeans are a good source of dietary protein, folate and iron. This legume species was moved from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna and is correctly cites as Vigna radiata."
