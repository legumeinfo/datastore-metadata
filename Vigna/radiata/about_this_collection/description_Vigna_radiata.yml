description: "Mungbean (Vigna radiata), also known as moong bean, green gram, is a fast-growing warm-season legume and has a diploid chromosome number of 2n=22. Mungbean is mainly cultivated today in China, India and Southeast Asia but can be found in dry regions within Southern Europe and United States. Mungbeans are a good source of dietary protein, folate and iron. This legume species was moved from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna and is correctly cites as Vigna radiata."

    description: "Vigna radiata accession VC1973A was chosen for genome sequencing. VC1973A was developed at the AVRDC-The World Vegetable Center in 1982; since then, it has been widely grown in Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Canada and China as a heteronymous cultivar called 'Seonhwanogdu' in Korea, 'Kamphaeng Saen 1' in Thailand and 'Zhong Lu' in China. Accession description is from Kang et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1038/ncomms6443)."
