description: "Adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) is a diploid legume crop (2n = 2x = 22). Adzuki beans are commonly sweetened before eating by boiling the beans with sugar, resulting in red bean paste. The adzuki bean is a good dietary source for a variety of minerals including; magnesium, potassium and zinc. Genome assemblies have been generated for several accessions."
